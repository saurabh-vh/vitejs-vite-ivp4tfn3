# Changelog

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-19

- Updated dependencies.

### Fixed

- Improved the reprojection during temporal upscaling.
- Fixed noise in the velocity vector during temporal upscaling.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-07-14

### Changed

- Updated the dependency to atmosphere.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-05

### Added

- `CloudsEffect`: Added `singleMieScatteringTexture` and `higherOrderScatteringTexture` props.

### Changed

- Removed `photometric` options and props. It outputs luminance only now.
- Removed the shadow length attenuation hack.
- React components no longer trigger React state changes when textures are loaded.
- `CloudsEffect`: Deprecated and renamed `skyIrradianceScale`, `groundIrradianceScale` and `accurateSunSkyIrradiance` to `skyLightScale`, `groundBounceScale` and `accurateSunSkyLight`.
- Migrated to core API changes.
- Updated dependencies.

### Fixed

- Fixed unnecessary side effects of type-only imports.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-12

### Changed

- Added support for absorption in haze.
- `CloudsMaterial`: Changed the default values of both `skyIrradianceScale` and `groundIrradianceScale` to 1.
- `CloudsMaterial`: Added `hazeScatteringCoefficient` and `hazeAbsorptionCoefficient` which are separated from those of the clouds.
- Removed the use of `forwardRef` and added it in props.

### Fixed

- Adjusted the scaling of irradiance for cloud particles to better reflect isotropic scattering.
- Added a workaround so that the unlit rays towards far clouds appear orange.
- Fixed incorrect handling of cloud transmittance and inscattered light when compositing into the render buffer.
- Changed the behavior of unlit rays through haze so that they don't occlude sky light.
- Improved approximation of the haze integral to reduce unnatural gradient just above the clouds at the horizon.
- Fixed scene depth conversion when logarithmic depth is used, [#66](https://github.com/takram-design-engineering/three-geospatial/pull/66).

## [0.2.2] - 2025-05-23

### Fixed

- Removed `process.env.NODE_ENV` from the ES build output.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-03-14

### Fixed
